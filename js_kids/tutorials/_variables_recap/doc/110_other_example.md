# Other example

Let’s take one more example to better understand functions with parameters. Let’s plan to build a mathematical function that will accept 2 numbers as arguments and then display their sum.

Our function will be simply called `add`. To define it and use it type in the code editor the following code:

```
add(2,3);
add(100, 200);

function add(a, b)
{
    let sum = a + b;
    alert(a + '+' + b + '=' + sum);
}
```

Take your time! This is a lot of code to type. When done, click Play to run your code.
