# Computer can also display texts

Until now, our programs used only numbers inside. However – it is useful in many cases to display or manipulate also text.

JavaScript calls text: *strings*. The proper way to define a string in JavaScript is to place your message in between single or double quotes like this 'coding or "coding". The only requirement is to use the same type of quote for both opening and closing of the string.

Like numbers, strings can also be assigned to variables or used inside functions. Just make sure you use a string where it makes sense. For instance if a function call expects a number (e.g. such as a coordinate), please provide a number, and not a string – otherwise you may get an error.

Exercise: Type in the code editor:

```
alert('Hello coder!');
```

Do you see the expected result? If not please take your time to check the code correctly. Read the error message that the computer produces and try to figure out what you did wrong. Fix and repeat if necessary.
