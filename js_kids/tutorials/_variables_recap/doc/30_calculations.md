# Computer helps with calculations

Let’s remember from variables and expressions lesson that instead of the simple 1 and 2 numbers, we can actually put full expressions and let the computer calculate the result.

Isn’t this a cool feature that we can use to make our own calculator?

In the code editor add the following lines:

```
alert(2 + 3 * 5);
alert( (2 + 3) * 5 );
```

Notice that the second alert has a somehow complex expressions inside with its’ own parenthesis.

In JavaScript, you can define the order of operations inside expressions by using parenthesis. In this way we expect the first alert to display `17` while the second one to display `25`. Just like in math!

> Note: A common beginners mistake is to not close all open parenthesis. Please make sure that all open parenthesis are closed ... especially in the second alert that is more tricky.
