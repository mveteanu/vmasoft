# Functions can be parametrized

Notice that when we call our `greet();` function, we don’t put anything in between the parenthesis. This is because we don’t pass the function any arguments. 

By contrast we always passed arguments to the built in functions that we used until now: `alert('Hello');` , `circle(400, 300, 100);` etc.

The good news is that we can also pass arguments to our custom functions. For instance we can make `greet` accept a person name as argument and then greet that particular person.

Exercise: In the code editor, place your cursor in between the parenthesis of the `greet` call. Type your name in between quotes (you’re basically typing your name as a string). 

Run the code? Do you see any difference from before?
