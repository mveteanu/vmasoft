# Functions can be parametrized

Your program is still outputting the same message regardless of the argument we used with the greet() function. This is because the argument is never used by the function body. In other words the code that the function has in between its curly brackets is the same as before.

What we need to do is to change the function definition to specify that the function should accept one argument, and then use that argument as part of the function body.
