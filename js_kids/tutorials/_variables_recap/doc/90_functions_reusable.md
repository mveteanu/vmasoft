# Functions are reusable

Until now we saw how to define a function and how to call it. Even if we wrote extra code, the effect was the same as before implementing the function. 

Youâ€™re probably wondering why are we putting all this extra effort in our programs?

The main reason is that functions are reusable pieces of functionality. Once defined, we can use a function as many times as necessary.

In the code editor on the right, duplicate the first `greet();` line and re-run the program. 

Do you see how the message is displayed twice?
