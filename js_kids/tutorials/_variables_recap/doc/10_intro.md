# Introduction

This lesson is a recap of variables, expressions and functions. These concepts are so important in coding that we’ve decided to create a re-cap lesson that will present again these concepts… perhaps from a different angle.

Some students may even find more approachable this recap lesson than the original ones.

This lesson has also some new elements as well: we’ll introduce here the concept of *strings*!
