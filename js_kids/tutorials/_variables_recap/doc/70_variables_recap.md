# Variables recap

Of course, if this whole use of parenthesis for dictating the operation order is confusing, you can always use a separate variable to hold the intermediate result:

```
let sum = 2 + 3;
alert('Sum=' + sum);
```

Letâ€™s remember that variables can hold values either specified directly such as `let a = 2;` or obtained as a result of a calculation such as `let sum = 2 + 3;`
