# Functions can be parametrized

Please notice the updated function definition in the code editor. We’ve added `msg` in between the parenthesis and then inside the function body we used this `msg`.

From the practical point of view the msg is behaving like a regular variable, therefore because it can take part in expressions, we can use it as part of the string concatenation.

> Notice: exactly like with variable names, you don’t put quotes around function parameters...

Try playing now the code. See the difference! Replace the string you’re passing to greet with your actual name. Have fun.
