# Functions recap

As we saw in the previous lesson, JavaScript has the ability to define new functions (e.g. new instructions) that will be used exactly like the built in ones.
For instance, let’s define a function named “greet” that will display “Hello coder”. In order to do this, type the following code in the code editor:

```
function greet()
{
	alert('Hello coder');
}
```

If you play the code at this point, nothing will appear because we didn’t use yet our newly defined function. In order to the function we have to “call it” like this:

```
greet();
```

(please type this line just above the function definition).
