# Strings in expressions

As mentioned on the previous steps, strings can also participate in expressions. However, unlike numbers (which can be added, multiplied, divided, etc.) strings can only be “added” with other strings or as the professional are saying “concatenated”.

Check the code in the editor:

```
alert('Hello coder');
alert('Hello' + ' coder');
```

If you run the code, you’ll see that the result of the second line is the same as the first line. This is because the “+” operator is concatenating together the two smaller strings “Hello” and “ coder”. (the second strings starts with a space character.)
