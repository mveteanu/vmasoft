<h1>Circle radius</h1>

<p>If you managed to change the code as described on the previous page, you should’ve seen the computer draw a bigger circle on the screen.</p>
<p>This is because the 3rd parameter is the radius of the circle.</p>
<p>Feel free to continue playing with the radius of this circle. Try different numbers between 0 and 300. After each code modification press the “Play” button to execute the code.</p>
