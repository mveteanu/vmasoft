<h1>Know your environment</h1>

<p>Welcome to the wonderful world of coding!</p>

<p>Before we begin let’s get familiar with the environment. Look carefully at your screen. You should see two or three main areas: </p>

<ul>
	<li>The left area is where you’re currently reading this text. We call this the “tutorial bar”</li>
	<li>The next area is where you’ll write your code. This is the “code editor”</li>
	<li>The right area is where you’ll see the results of your code. This is the “output area”</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: If you don’t see the output area, you’re computer screen resolution is probably low and the output window doesn’t fit on the screen. But don’t worry: we will automatically display the output window when you’ll need to see it.</p>

<p>Now click the “Next” button below to advance this tutorial.</p>
