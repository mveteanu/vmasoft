<h1>Multiple instructions - 1</h1>

<p>We hope you had fun with the circle on the previous tutorial page. Did you saw the circles appearing in different positions or did you break altogether the code?</p>
<p>Don’t worry. We’ve put for you in the code editor a fresh circle instruction: circle(400, 300, 100);</p>

<p>Adding extra instructions:</p>

<p>Using copy and paste operations, copy this instruction at least 2 more times below the original one. If you need a little bit of help click “Next” in this tutorial and we’ll copy the instructions for you.</p>
