<h1>Fun drawing</h1>

<p>We cannot end this tutorial without having a fun drawing using only circles. Checkout the code on the right!</p>
<p>Press “Play” and enjoy the drawing!</p>
<p>Can you tell which circle instruction draws what part? It is difficult since we still have to learn more about the coordinates and other elements of the drawing system.</p>
<p>Even advanced coders will find difficult to read others people code… or even their own code after a while.</p>
<p>A good way to remember what a certain portion of a code is doing is to “comment the code”. Hit “Next” to see the same code commented.</p>
