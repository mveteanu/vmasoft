# Functions are reusable

You may wonder why we went this far to define a custom function and then call it in order to have the same effect as the original code without custom functions?

And the main reason is because functions are reusable. Once defined, we can call a function as many times as we want.

Remember that until now we called `circle` or `rect` several times in our programs? ... just by knowing their name and not caring about their actual implementation.

Duplicate now the first line in the code editor, and before executing the program try to anticipate the result. Do you think you will see two houses or one house?
