# Observations

Notice that your function body is using the `x` and `y` as regular variables, inside expressions... in the same way the variable `h` is used.

We now have complete example on how to define and then call / use a function with parameters. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t remember the syntax for defining a function, on the left toolbox pallete there is a “function” block. Just drag-and-drop that block in your code and you should be good to go!
