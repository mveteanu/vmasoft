# Planning a new instruction

As we stated at the beginning of this tutorial JavaScript has an important feature that allows coders to define new “instructions” indistinguishable from the built-in ones such as `circle` and `rect`.

Let’s use this feature and create a new instruction named `drawHouse` that will basically draw an entire house (walls, roof, windows, etc.) in one single shot.

Since it is our instruction it is up to us how we name it. It is recommended however to put a meaningful name that we can easily remember later on. 

And of course JavaScript will also add a few more restrictions such as:

-	Use a single word for the name of the instruction. If you want to use multiple words, just put them one after the other without any space in between
-	We recommend you to avoid special symbols and only use lowercase and uppercase letters and numbers in the name of the function… although never start a function name with a number.
