# Code identation

You probably noticed that the code lines inside the function body (inside the curly brakets) are idented to the right.
We achieved this effect by pressing the "Tab" key in front of each line.

As mentioned before JavaScript doesn't care about code formating. However, for us humans, the code become much easier to read. We can clearly see that the those lines are part of the function body.

We highly recommend you to properly ident your code.
