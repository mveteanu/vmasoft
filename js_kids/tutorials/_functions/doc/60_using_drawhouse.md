# Using our drawHouse function

You’re probably asking yourself why you don’t see any drawing on the canvas even if you copied the code correctly?
And the reason is very simple: we just defined our new custom function. In order for the computer to execute our function we have to instruct it to do it.

Go in the code editor, above the function definition, and type the function name followed by `()`, like this:

```
drawHouse();
```

What you just type is a function call. It is a way in which we tell the computer to execute the drawHouse function that is defined somewhere in our code.

Please make sure that the name you just typed is identical with the one used in the function definition. Otherwise the computer won’t know what function to call. There is no exception from this rule. Even the casing of the letters has to be the same since JavaScript is case sensitive.

OK. Enough theory. Press Play now and if you typed everything correctly you should see now again the mini house.
