# Define drawHouse

To instruct the computer to create our drawHouse instruction for us we have to use the following syntax:

```
function drawHouse()
{
}
```

Let’s take a few minutes to analyze this small code and then we’ll let you type it the code editor.

-	The first thing you’ll probably notice is the keyword “function”. This keyword allows us to define the new instruction that has the name specified immediately after. We are also required to put open and close a round parenthesis after the custom name.
-	The second important thing to notice are the curly brackets `{}` beneath the first line. In between these brackets we will have the chance to write a series of instructions that will be used automatically when our main `drawHouse` instruction is used.

> Note: JavaScript instructions are called “functions”. This is the proper term to refer to `circle`, `rect` as well as to our `drawHouse`. All these are JavaScript functions. `circle` and `rect` are built-in functions, while `drawHouse` is a custom defined function. Until now we used the term “instruction” in order to better illustrate their role. However – from now on, we will switch to the professional term and refer to these constructs as “functions”.

Now go ahead and type in the code editor this small code snippet. When done press Play to check your work. If you get blank canvas with no error, it means you typed to code correctly.
