<h1>Tinker the instruction</h1>

<p>Let’s take a second and analyze the instruction in the code area:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Notice the “circle” word. This is the actual instruction that tells your computer to draw a circle on the screen in the output area.</li>
    <li>After the “circle”, in between parenthesis, there are 3 numbers separated by comma “,”. We call these the parameters of the instruction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now click in the code editor area and try to change the 3rd parameter from 100 to 300. Be careful to change just the number and nothing else. Do not add or delete any other symbol or number.</p>

<p>When ready press the “Play” button!</p>

<p>Do you see anything different with the circle? … or you managed to break the code? Click “Next” to understand what you did.</p>
