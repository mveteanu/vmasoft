<h1>Circle position</h1>

<p>Until now we varied only the radius of the circle. What if we want to control the position where the circle is drawn on the screen?</p>
<p>This is actually what the first two parameters of the “circle” instruction are telling. They specify the coordinates of the center of the circle.</p>
<p>Note: Don’t let the “coordinates” term scare you. We’ll teach you about coordinates in a future tutorial.</p>

<p>At this moment let’s just play with the coordinates: in the code editor, try to choose different combinations for the parameters:</p>

<ul>
    <li>First parameter: number between 0 and 800</li>
    <li>Second parameter: number between 0 and 600</li>
    <li>Third parameter: number between 0 and 300</li>
</ul>

<p>After each code modification press the “Play” button to see the effects. Don’t rush! Spend at least 5 minutes tinkering the parameters and observing the effects.</p>
