# Implement drawHouse function

In the previous step we’ve created the basic definition for our `drawHouse` custom function. It is now time to add some instructions in between those curly brackets.

Rather than typing by hand the code that we want to put in between the brackets, let’s proceed in this way:

-	Please take a note on the tutorial step you’re currently on.
-	Go back a few steps in this tutorial and copy in the clipboard from the code editor the entire code that draws the mini-house.
-	Come back to this current step and paste in between the brackets your code

As always, click Play to check your work. It is also expected to get a blank canvas with no error.

Either way, click Next to advance
