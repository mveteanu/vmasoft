# Fun drawing

We cannot end this tutorial without having a fun drawing using only circles. Checkout the code on the right!

Press “Play” and enjoy the drawing!

Can you tell which circle instruction draws what part? It is difficult since we still have to learn more about the coordinates and other elements of the drawing system.

Even advanced coders will find difficult to read others people code… or even their own code after a while.

A good way to remember what a certain portion of a code is doing is to “comment the code”. Hit “Next” to see the same code commented.
