# Multiple instructions - 1

We hope you had fun with the circle on the previous tutorial page. Did you saw the circles appearing in different positions or did you break altogether the code?

Don’t worry. We’ve put for you in the code editor a fresh circle instruction: 

```
circle(400, 300, 100);
```

## Adding extra instructions:

Using copy and paste operations, copy this instruction at least 2 more times below the original one. If you need a little bit of help click “Next” in this tutorial and we’ll copy the instructions for you.
