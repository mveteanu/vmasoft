# Know your environment

Welcome to the wonderful world of coding!

Before we begin let’s get familiar with the environment. Look carefully at your screen. You should see two or three main areas:

* The left area is where you’re currently reading this text. We call this the “tutorial bar”
* The next area is where you’ll write your code. This is the “code editor”
* The right area is where you’ll see the results of your code. This is the “output area”

> Note: If you don’t see the output area, you’re computer screen resolution is probably low and the output window doesn’t fit on the screen. 
> But don’t worry: we will automatically display the output window when you’ll need to see it.

Now click the “Next” button below to advance this tutorial.
