# Multiple instructions - 2

On the right you should see now three identical lines of code! This represents a multi-line program. Until now we executed just one instruction at a time, but the actual power of coding consists in telling the computer to execute a longer list of instructions arranged in the desired order.

Computers are very good at executing multiple instructions. It can do this with amazing speed executing millions and millions of instructions per second.

For now – however our code has only three instructions. Let’s try to execute the code and see the effect!

To some surprise the output is still a single circle, even if we have three circle instructions. In reality, the computer is drawing three circles, but since all of them have the same parameters, the circles are drawn in the same position on top of the previous one.

Go ahead and change the parameters of these instructions so you can draw three distinct circles.
