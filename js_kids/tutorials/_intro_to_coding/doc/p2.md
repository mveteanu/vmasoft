# Your first instruction

Look on the right, in the code editor. We put there a computer instruction.

Are you eager to see what it does?

Just press the big “Play” button and the computer will execute whatever instruction(s) are in the code editor.


And of course you can press the “Stop” button if you want to stop the execution of your code.
