# Understanding instructions

If everything went OK, you should’ve seen a *circle* appearing in the output area. This is exactly what we’ve instructed your computer to do: to draw a circle.

```
circle(400, 300, 100);
```

Your computer is exactly like an obedient dog. It executes precisely each and every command we give to it.

The only requirement: to know what instruction to give and to spell that instruction correctly. The computer will greatly complain even if you miss a single punctuation sign!
