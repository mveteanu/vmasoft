# Circle position

Until now we varied only the radius of the circle. What if we want to control the position where the circle is drawn on the screen?

This is actually what the first two parameters of the “circle” instruction are telling. They specify the coordinates of the center of the circle.

Note: Don’t let the “coordinates” term scare you. We’ll teach you about coordinates in a future tutorial.

At this moment let’s just play with the coordinates: in the code editor, try to choose different combinations for the parameters:

* First parameter: number between 0 and 800
* Second parameter: number between 0 and 600
* Third parameter: number between 0 and 300

After each code modification press the “Play” button to see the effects. Don’t rush! Spend at least 5 minutes tinkering the parameters and observing the effects.
