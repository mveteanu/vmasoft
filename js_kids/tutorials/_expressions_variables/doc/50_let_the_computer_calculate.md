# Let the computer calculate

These calculations are pretty simple... but why calculate them ourselves when we have a powerful computer at our disposal?

Let’s put those calculations in our code and let the computer do the hard work for us:

In the code editor, try to replace:

-	`350` with `400 - 100 /2`
-	`250` with `300 - 100 / 2`

and

-   `450` with `400 + 100 / 2`
-	`200` with `300 – 100 / 2 – 100 / 2`

When you believe you finish the replacement, press Play to see the result. It should be the same as before.
