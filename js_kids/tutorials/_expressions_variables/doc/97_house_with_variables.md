# House with variables

If the code you wrote on the previous page looks like the one in the code editor – you completed the exercise correctly.

With house size and position defined as variables, we can easily control the house drawing my doing only minor changes to our code.

Go ahead and play with the values of the variables:

-	Vary h between 10 and 200
-	Vary x between 0 and 800
-	Vary y between 0 and 600

After each modification, re-run the program to see the effect.

Click ‘Next’ when done.
