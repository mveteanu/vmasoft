# A small house

Let’s start our exploration by drawing a small house in the middle of the screen. For this we will use the ‘rect ’ and ‘line’ instructions introduced in previous lessons.

Go ahead and type this in the code editor. Take your time when you type. Make sure you type all characters exactly as you see below:

```
rect(350, 250, 100, 100);
line(350, 250, 400, 200);
line(400, 200, 450, 250);
```

> A quick refresher: 400 and 300 are coordinates of the middle of the screen. The mini house coordinates have been calculated around these middle screen values.

After you finish typing press the ‘Play’ button to test your code. 

Don’t get discouraged if you got and error. Check carefully your code against the example, correct if necessarily  and Play again.
