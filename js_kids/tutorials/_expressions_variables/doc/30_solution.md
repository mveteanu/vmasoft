# Solution

We are hoping that you typed correctly the mini house code on the previous page. Learning to type is a really important skill in learning to code.

If your code on the previous page produced an error, try pressing ‘Play’ again. We fixed it for you.

Now, take a few minutes and analyze the code. Can you tell how we came up with `350` and `250` as coordinates for the rectangle corner?
