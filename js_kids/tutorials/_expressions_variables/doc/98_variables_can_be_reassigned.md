# Variables can be re-assigned

Perhaps one of the most powerful features of variables is the fact that they can be re-assigned with a different value at a later time in the code. These is a the reason they are called “variables” – their value can vary (e.g. change) during the execution of a program.

To re-assign a value you just use the equal sign like this:

```
x = 100;
```

> Note: The `let` instruction is used only when you define the variable. When you change the value of that variable you just use the equal sign / operator. You can change the value as many times as you want.

Exercise: In the code editor, try to type the above line, after the lines that define the variables and just before the line with the `rect` instruction.

As usual, you can find the solution of the next page.
