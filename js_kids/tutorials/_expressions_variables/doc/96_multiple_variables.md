# Multiple variables

Our programs are not limited to just 1 variable. As a matter of fact you can define practically an unlimited number of variables.

Let’s define two additional variables named `x` and `y` that will hold the coordinates where we want to draw our mini house:

```
let x = 400;
let y = 300;
```

In the code editor, add the above two lines at the very beginning of the program (before the first line).

Then replace in the code all occurrences of `400` with `x` and all occurrences of `300` with `y`.

Take your time and try to do this exercise right. When done press ‘Play’ to see the effect. If the mini-house still appears on the canvas, you wrote the code correctly.

Press ‘Next’ when done.
