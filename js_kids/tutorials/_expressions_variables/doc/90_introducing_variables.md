# Introducing variables

JavaScript allows to define “variables”. A variable is a name that contains a value or expression. Each time you use that name in your code, the computer will actually use the value represented by that name.

Sounds complicated but let’s see this concept through an example. In our code, we can define the height of the house as a variable. Let’s name this variable `h`. The proper way to let the computer know that we need to define a variable and assign a value to it is like this:

```
let h = 100;
```

`let` keyword instructs the computer to define the variable with the specified name.

Note: You can use any letter or even combinations of letters and numbers for the name of the variable. As long as the variable name is not starting with a number or is not identical with a reserved JavaScript language keyword / instruction, you’re good to go. 

All of the following are valid variable names:

`a`, `b`, `c`, ... , `A`, `B`, `a1`, `b1`, `myName`, `houseSize`, `x`, `y`, `z`


> People try to use meaningful letters or words for the names of the variables in order to refer to them easily at a later time. However, the computer doesn’t care if you name your variable in English or Romanian... as long as you use them identically at a later time.

`let` doesn’t have any visual effect. If you try to run this code, nothing will happen. Click ‘Next’ to see how to use the newly defined variable inside our mini-house program.
