# A bigger house

Let’s suppose we changed our mind and we have to draw a bigger house. Instead of 100 pixels wide by `100` pixels height, our main square should be `200` by `200` pixels.

Since our code contains the expressions that do the calculations, we only need to replace `100` with `200` wherever is needed.

Go ahead and change the code on the right. When done press ‘Play’ to see the result. If you don’t get the expected result, check the code carefully.

As always the full solution expects you on the next page.
