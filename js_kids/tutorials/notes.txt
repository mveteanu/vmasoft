- open a sketch: code.html?1

- open a tutorial: code.html?t=intro-to-graphics
- open a tutorial sketch: code.html?intro-to-graphics-1 (e.g. "-" in name indicate a tutorial... code is after last "-")
- open a tutorial sketch using tutorial code: code.html?1001 (e.g. first 3 digits represent the tutorial id, then the sketch id)

... on the main page I should list the tutorials by date (newer first)... but also list them in *playlists*... overtime add new tutorials to various lists:
    - level 1
    - level 2
    - level 3
    - math
    - sprite games
    - graphics
    - logic games
    - javascript elements
    - string processing
    - etc.
