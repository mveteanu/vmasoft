One way to display short messages in dialog boxes is via the `alert` instruction.

For instance type the following code in the code editor and hit “Play”:

```
alert(1);
```

Do you see the dialog box with number `1` inside? This is the effect of the `alert` instruction.

> Note: Chrome users – please don’t check the ckeckbox displayed by the dialog. That will prevent other dialogs from appearing!

## Two dialogs

Can you add one more alert line beneath the first one? What about to display number 2? Please take your time and try to do this exercise.

If you typed the code correctly, you should see the first dialog appearing and upon closing the second one will be displayed. This is a normal behavior since `alert()` is a blocking instruction that stops the program execution until the dialog is closed.
