# Establishing the grid paper dimensions

The first step in our program is to draw the grid paper.

Therefore, we need to decide how many rows and how many columns we want on the canvas… and of course what will be each cell / square size.

Let’s define couple of constants to hold this information. 

```
const squareSize = 16;
const noRows = 30;
const noCols = 50;
```

These constants act like settings for our program. We can come back and modify them later and the entire program will reflect the new values.
