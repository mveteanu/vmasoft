# Avoid the clicks

The program on the previous page of the tutorial did the job just fine... but the constant mouse clicking was kind of anoying.

We can avoid the mouse clicks by moving all the code in the `mousePressed` function in the `loop` function.

> Remember: The `mouseClicked` was called by the runtime each time the mouse button was clicked. The `loop` function will be also automatically called by the runtime many - many times per second.

Run now the program and observer the difference in behavior!
