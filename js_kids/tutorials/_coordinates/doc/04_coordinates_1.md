# Coordinates

When we draw a shape or character in CodeGuppy we need to specify where we want to draw it. Do we want to appear in the middle of the screen or a little bit to the left or right?

We specify this position by “coordinates”.

Since the canvas is a flat surface we need to use just 2 numbers as coordinates: one for horizontal and one for the vertical.
