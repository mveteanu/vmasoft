# Pixels

Look on the right side of the screen. Thatâ€™s your output area also called the *canvas*. 

Although it looks at this moment like a big white surface, the canvas is made up of many small dots that you can turn black or white or even color them through the code. These dots are called pixels.

In a sense the canvas is like a graph paper (grid paper), with each grid paper square being a tiny pixel on the canvas.
