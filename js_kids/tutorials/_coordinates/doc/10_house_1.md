# Fun drawing

Let’s draw with code! 

We'll use the instructions in our toolbox: `line`, `rect` and `circle` to draw a house on the canvas!

## Planning

On a blank piece of paper draw a big rectangle. That’s your canvas.

Inside the rectangle, try to reproduce the following house using only straight lines and circles. 
Next identify what will be the coordinates for each line, rectangle and circle... (approximations are fine)

... take your time.
