# Revisiting circle

Is time now to revisit the `circle` instruction that we used in the [Intro to coding](tutorial://1) tutorial:

```
circle(400, 300, 100);
```

Let’s better understand the parameters of this instruction:

* The first 2 parameters are the coordinates of the center of the circle. 400 = the coordinate on horizontal, 300 the coordinate on vertical. As we saw (400, 300) is also the middle of the canvas, that’s why our circle appeared in the middle of the canvas. 
* The third parameter is the radius of the circle. The radius is also expressed in pixels
