# Extending the toolbox

You have now in your toolbox 2 instructions that you can use to draw shapes on the canvas: `point` and `circle`.

Letâ€™s extend this toolbox with 2 more instructions that you can use to draw a straight lines and rectangles. 

## Drawing lines

The instruction is simply called `line` and takes 4 parameters: the x and y coordinates for each end of the line. By specifying the coordinates of each end you can draw a line between any two pixels on the canvas:

```
line(250, 100, 550, 100);
line(250, 500, 550, 500);
```

## Drawing rectangles

The instruction for drawing rectangles is called `rect`. The first two parameters specify the coordinates of the top-left corner, while the other two parameters, specify the width and height of the rectangle.

```
rect(250, 200, 300, 200);
```

Run the code to see the effect. Can you now change the coordinates of the line so it is displayed on vertical rather than horizontal?
