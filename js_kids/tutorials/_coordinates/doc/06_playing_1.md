# Playing with coordinates

Enough theory! Letâ€™s use some code to turn on some pixels.

Take a look in the code editor: can you tell without hitting play what this code is supposed to do?

## Hint

The `point` instruction is putting a single point on the canvas at the specified coordinates. The first number is the coordinate on horizontal (also called x) and the second number the coordinate on vertical (y).

> Note: After you run the code, look closely in the corners of the canvas to see the pixels. They are really small.
