# Fun drawing – commented

Looks much better! Right!

Notice the natural language texts placed from place to place in the code. These are comments. Since comments are meant for humans, and not for the computer, we have to put two slash characters `//` in front of each line of comment.

```
// This is a comment
```

The computer will basically ignore the lines that start with `//`. You can put on that line whatever you want… the computer will not complain about incorrect syntax or unknown instructions. Is it as those lines don’t even exist at all in the code.
