With CodeBeanz you'll code and run real games and applications directly in your browser. You don't need to install any software on your local machine. Any Windows, Mac or Chromebook computer is perfect for CodeBeanz.

At CodeBeanz.com we teach JavaScript - the most used and popular programming language nowadays. Kids and creative adults alike learn JavaScript and many other computer science concepts through creative programming by making fun games.

On CodeBeanz we made sharing as simple as clicking a button since we believe learning to code is more engaging when you can share your work with others. It's up to you if you share just the playable version of your game / applcation or if you share the source code as well.

CodeBeanz is 2 platforms in one: a code learning platform driven by bite-sized interactive tutorials and a coding/play/share platform powered by our unique code editor.

We offer step by step project based lessons for kids to learn the JavaScript language and other computer science concepts. A unique feature of our platform is that we don't enforce the order in which kids select  the projects / tutorials. As a matter of fact we encorage kids to explore and tinker with all tuturials no matter what is their coding skills. Kids are more engaged when they choose their own the tutorial that looks more attractive. Some may prefer to understand how to build a platformer game, while others may be interested in creating with code and sending an interactive invitation to their friends.

We also allow kids to create their own library of games and applications. These can be either coded from scratch or by remixing the code that comes with a tutorial or is shared by a friend.
