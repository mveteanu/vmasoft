- animate sprites also for static scenes (without loop) by redirecting the drawing functions 
  in an offscreen buffer (probably using the "with" method by wrapping the -entire- code in the "with" statement)

- implement layered backgrounds ... which are basically a static background plus an animated "sketch"
  the user will use background("static,animated");
