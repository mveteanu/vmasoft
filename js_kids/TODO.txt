- implement layered backgrounds ... which are basically a static background plus an animated "sketch"
  the user will use background("static,animated");

- investigate splitter from https://github.com/nathancahill/Split.js

- see why sketch doesn't recover if errors

- call camera.off() at the beginning of draw()

- need to make sure it runs in minimum resolution 1024x768 (check vertical resolution as well)

- maybe sketches should autorun upon opening (e.g. uncomment the run() line in Shell.js)

- also ... maybe if there is no code in the sketch / scene, then the draw() should display a nice message / animation
  instructing how to write code... e.g. in Sketch.js -> getSceneWrapper() and CodeUtils.js -> getSceneFunction()
