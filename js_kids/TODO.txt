- implement layered backgrounds ... which are basically a static background plus an animated "sketch"
  the user will use background("static,animated");

- investigate splitter from https://github.com/nathancahill/Split.js

- need to make sure it runs in minimum resolution 1024x768 (check vertical resolution as well)

- maybe sketches should autorun upon opening (e.g. uncomment the run() line in Shell.js) ??

- also ... maybe if there is no code in the sketch / scene, then the draw() should display a nice message / animation
  instructing how to write code... e.g. in Sketch.js -> getSceneWrapper() and CodeUtils.js -> getSceneFunction()
  
- consider the following functions:
  - noClear() <-- the main draw won't apply automatically the background clearing the screen for the loop()
  - fastLoop() <-- by default the scenes will run with buffering ... but if this call is present in the static area... then the scene will be run without buffering (currently there is the "buffer" query string parameter to control this behavior)

  ... OR ...

- consider adding also event draw() to be used in advanced sketches in place of loop()
  If user will use draw() then the engine won't clear the screen automatically ... and no buffering will be used! - Like in p5.js
